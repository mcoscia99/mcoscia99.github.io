# My Personal Site

Matthew Coscia

My first website is a basic portfolio for myself built using HTML, CSS and SCSS.
I have four pages; "Home," "Projects," "Courses" and "About me."

Home --> A simple home page
Projects --> A page containing images and stylized links to github.
Courses --> A page highlighting my coursework through a series of tables.
About me --> A page containing a short blurb about me, a summary of my
             programming skills, a summary of my campus involvement and some more resources.

Each page includes a navigation bar at the top which allows users to toggle
between the pages. Flexbox and a small screen media query make the site responsive to
size changes.
